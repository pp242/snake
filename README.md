# Snake

Based on the game that was on the nokia phones in the late 1990's and early 2000's, this is a game where you(the snake) can move around the screen, and navigate yourself towards the food(red square) in order to score points. However the more food you eat, the larger your body gets and any collision with your body or any of the walls will result in death.

# Instructions 

The aim of the game is to beat all your friends with the highest score possible on the game and have the top spot of the leaderboard. The direction arrows are to be used to direct the snake in the direction of your choice. The menu and other pages are all clicked based and to change the difficulty and the colour of the snake, the buttons for them can be found on the settings page.

# Languages

The languages used in the game are Javascript, CSS and HTML. The language that was most used was the Javascript as there were many different types functions that were required for the game to work, as it is a collision based game and it needed alot of them. Jquery was used throughout the game so that click functions and others could be deployed.
