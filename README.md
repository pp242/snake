# Snake

Based on the game that was on the nokia phones in the late 1990's and early 2000's, this is a game where you(the snake) can move around the screen, and navigate yourself towards the food(red square) in order to score points. However the more food you eat, the larger your body gets and any collision with your body or any of the walls will result in death.
